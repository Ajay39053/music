Subject: [OC] Hey all, I've built a distributed torrent-based music service and desktop app called TorrentTunes[BETA]. Let me know what you guys think.

So I've spent the past few months working on this program/website, and I'd like to know what you guys think. Description from [Github](https://github.com/tchoulihan/torrenttunes-client):

[TorrentTunes](http://torrenttunes.tk) is an open-source, [BitTorrent-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) music service, like Rdio or Spotify, where you can stream any music, or share your own library of music with others.

Each individual song is tagged using [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/), and shared as a *.torrent* file using the client's built-in, [LibTorrent-based](http://www.libtorrent.org/) BitTorrent client, on publicly available trackers.

TorrentTunes works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and also has a web client at [torrenttunes.tk](http://torrenttunes.tk).

Suggest features, new music, or post bugs [here](https://github.com/tchoulihan/torrenttunes-client/issues/), or on the subreddit [r/torrenttunes](http://www.reddit.com/r/torrenttunes).
